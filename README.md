This website was built as a part of my Design Interactive Systems (DIS) course assignment at IIIT-Delhi. It serves as an interactive, engaging portfolio showcasing my design and development skills — with features that reflect both creativity and user-centered thinking.

🧩 Features Overview
🧠 Intelligent Assistant (Avatar)

    A dynamic 2D avatar assistant greets the user based on the time of day.

    Designed with a game-like, cartoony aesthetic.

    Foundation laid for future affective computing-based interactivity.

🎴 Drag Cards

    A horizontal drag card component that highlights key areas or fun facts.

    Uses framer-motion for smooth animations and responsiveness.
